					<p>As someone who has toyed around on websites since middle school, it has always been fun to see the different types of websites I could create. Giving each and everyone their own personality, feeling, and style was something I enjoyed, even if was on website builders that did most of the work for you. Now a days, I'm learning how to hard code websites, gaining more control over how the sites looks, and being able to make it look exactly as I want it too.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to using HTML and CSS (with basic and in training knowledge of JavaScript), I am also familiar with many Adobe products. Some of my strengths are video editing in Premiere Pro and manipulating photos in Photoshop. I have used Illustrator a lot recently, but still have much more to learn compared to the other two programs. I've dabbled in Adobe XD, and have touched Adobe InDesign, but probably would need to learn more on those to be proficient at them.</p>
