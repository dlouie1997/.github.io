                <h3>
                    For the first time in franchise history, the Phoenix Suns get the top pick.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Phoenix Suns have been in the National Basketball Association since 1968, and have
                    never received the honor of holding the first pick in the 2018 NBA draft. This is a 
                    cruical moment in recent Phoenix Suns history, as they have struggled to get wins without
                    much talent on their team, and this first draft pick allows them to choose whichever 
                    young player they want from the cream of the crop first. A top talent prospect can
                    turn a franchise around and bring some wins to a city lacking them for a while.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the best top picks in recent history have included the likes of Lebron James,
                    Kyrie Irving, and Anthony Davis. These are all players who have franchise changing skills.
                    The Suns are hoping to land a top level talent that can give the Suns more wins immediately.

                    <b>Here are some of the top prospects for this draft class:</b><br>

                <h2 id="Leonard">Kawhi Leonard wants to be traded</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>NBA superstar Kawhi Leonard is unhappy with his current situation with the 
                    San Antonio Spurs.</h3>
                    <img src="images/leonard.jpg" alt="Kawhi Leonard">
                    <br>Finals MVP and superstar Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs is not happy with
                    his current situation in Texas. After an injury ridden year, Leonard and the Spurs seem
                    to no longer be on the same terms. During his injury, there seemed to be miscommunication
                    between Leonard and the Spurs.
                    <br>
                    <br>With free agency looming, many teams around the league are
                    eager to try and pick up a premium two way player like Leonard. Going to be 27 by the start of
                    next season, Leonard is in his prime, and would be an excellent player to pick up and keep 
                    long term if possible. Teams that are most interested and would have a good chance at 
                    landing him include the Boston Celtics, Philidelphia 76ers, and the Los Angeles Lakers. Leonard
                    still has one more year on his contract, so he could be risky for some teams as he could leave
                    that team next summer and leave them with nothing, which is why the Phoenix Suns would be on 
                    the fence of trying to go after him, but could happen given the right price.

                <h2 id="TopTeams">Top Young Teams 2018</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>There are many young teams on the rise, with budding talent and the potential to
                    make noise in the playoffs soon, if not now.</h3>
                    While the whole league is focused on teams like the Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets,
                    and whatever team Lebron James is on, there are other teams that are on the rise and will have their
                    shot at being one of the top teams in the League. Here's a few teams that in a few years, could be
                    the teams you see in the NBA Finals.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <p class="bolded">Boston Celtics</p>
                    <img src="images/celtics.jpg" alt="Celtics team">
                    <p>A team that already has some top level superstars, the Celtics also have many players under 25 that 
                    are turning into valuable players, if not outright stars themself. Being one game away from making the 
                    NBA Finals without two of their best players, Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, the Celtics were a dark 
                    horse team throughout the 2017-18 playoffs, even despite having the second best record in the Eastern 
                    Conference. Some of their young players, including rookie Jayson Tatum, second year player Jaylen Brown, 
                    and twenty four year old Terry Rozier, were able to exceed expectations and contribute and shock everyone.
                    With veteran players like Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, and old reliable Al Horford, the team was able to go
                    farther than anyone expected without a clear superstar. They played as a team, and considering they are
                    expecting both Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward back next season, they could be in contention for a championship
                    as early as next June.</p>

                    <p class="bolded">Denver Nuggets</p>
                    <img src="images/nuggets.jpg" alt="Denver Nuggets Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray">
                    <p>The Nuggets have promising young talent with the likes of Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray, and Gary Harris. All 23
                    years old or younger, the Nuggets have a nice core to build around. Falling short of the 8th and final spot in the
                    NBA playoffs by one game, not once, but twice in the past two years show that they are closing in on being a 
                    perennial playoff team. Given more time, a fully healthy roster, and adding solid pieces along the way, and the 
                    Denver Nuggets are on the rise to become a team to be reckoned with.</p>

                    <p class="bolded">Philadelphia 76ers</p>
                    <img src="images/sixers.jpg" alt="Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Markelle Fultz">
                    <p>With rising stars like Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, they brought back winning ways to Philadelphia. Factor in
                    Dario Saric, and recently drafted number one pick, Markelle Fultz, who hardly played due to injury
                    and you have four players with bright futures under the age of 25. They were able to grab the third best record last 
                    season with 52 wins, and were able to even knab a playoff series win. They fell in the second round, but considering 
                    in the past three seasons they won a combined 56 games, they made a big leap towards being a top team. Now that
                    they have a core of talented young players, add some solid role players and give them some more time to mesh and 
                    build chemistry, and they will only get better as a team.</p>
