                <p>
                    2018 marked the first time the Phoenix Suns got the first pick in the NBA Draft Lottery.

                    <p>
                        In 2010, the Phoenix Suns made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they
                        were only two wins away from going to the NBA finals. Unfortunately, they fell to 
                        the Los Angeles Lakers. Up until now, this was the last Phoenix Suns playoff
                        apperance.

                    <p>
                        One of the most well known Phoenix Suns players, Steve Nash, won back to back 
                        MVPs. The Most Valuable Player award is a prestigious award given to the player
                        that league deemed the best performing and most important player to their team, 
                        league-wide. This was also the era in which Steve Nash brought fun and fast paced
                        basketball to the Valley.

                    <p>
                        Known as the "Charles Barkley era," this marked one of the two times the Phoenix Suns
                        have made the NBA Finals. In 1993, the Phoenix Suns were two wins away from grabbing their 
                        first NBA Championship, but eventually fell to the Michael Jordan led Chicago Bulls.
                        Charles Barkley also won MVP in 1993.

                    <p>
                        The only other Finals trip for the Phoenix Suns happened in 1976. The Suns had an up and
                        down season, but were able to make it to the playoffs with a 42-40 record. They faced the Boston 
                        Celtics in the NBA Finals, a team who had at the time won 12 championships already. The Suns 
                        fought hard, but eventually fell in 6 games.

            <h2>1968</h2>
                <p>
                    <p>
                        1968 is the year the Phoenix Suns became an official NBA team. They paid a 2 million dollar
                        entry fee, and was formed and owned by Karl Eller. There were critics behind putting a 
                        basketball team in Phoenix, but it seems to have worked out well today.
