                    <h2>Connecting two students who help each other succeed</h2>
                    
                    <p>Peer tutoring is when two students, similar in age, work together to help each other succeed. This can be between a high schooler and a middle schooler or between two students in the same class. The beauty of peer tutoring is that both parties benefit from it. Not only does the tutee/student walk away with better understanding of academic content, but they feel more successful and confident. And for the tutor, not only do they learn to be role models and experience the joy of helping others, their own academic achievement is improved as a result.</p>

                            Peer tutors can offer your child an individualized learning experience that caters to their strengths and weaknesses as students. Through individually catered sessions, peer tutors facilitate active academic peer-peer discussions with their tutees and have greater relatability to your child than a traditional tutor may have. Peer Tutors also have a unique role in which they primarily serve as role models, motivating your child to try their best and succeed academically. In addition, peer tutoring fosters a comfortable and flexible environment which allows your child to ask questions and share their thoughts throughout their learning process freely, promoting greater overall comprehension and building their interpersonal social skills simultaneously. Research has also shown that peer tutoring serves the greatest benefits to students with cognitive or behavioral disabilities through providing them with specialized assistance from understanding and patient peer tutors. 96% of parents from the PeerSquared Summer Program would highly recommend peer tutoring!

When I first joined in my sophomore year, tutoring was really daunting and I was always trying to avoid tutees out of fear of messing up. But now I’m actively reaching out to those in need and having an amazing time with every Tutee. I’ve learned a lot last year, gained so many skills through tutoring, and I just love helping people. Knowing that you’ve made a difference in someone’s life is life-changing itself, and has made me fall in love with tutoring. It’s really an amazing club and I’m so happy I joined. This will stick with me for life. Thank you for everything."

                            Peer tutoring has been widely researched to be of the highest benefit to the peer tutors themselves. Through explaining concepts to tutess, peer tutors also gain a greater understanding of the content themselves and have a greater chance of retaining it in the long term. Peer tutoring effectively promotes academic gains across content areas and is tested as incredibly valuable for elementary, middle, and high school students. Peer tutoring pushes tutors beyond their comfort zone and requires them to constantly improve their collaboration and communication skills, making them more prepared and well-rounded communicators and leaders. Tutoring also augments the peer tutors’ confidence in their capabilities and motivates them to aim for notable achievements in their lifetime. 92% of the peer tutors that were part of our summer tutoring program believe that peer tutoring has increased their confidence. Moreover, a large percent of them felt that peer tutoring improved their leadership skills and enhanced their highschool experience through allowing them to make invaluable contributions toward their communities.
