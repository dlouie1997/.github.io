						</h3>
						
						<h4> 
							Here is a brief timeline of the most memorable moments in the Phoenix Suns history.
						</h4>
						
						<h2>2018</h2>
							<p>
								2018 marked the first time the Phoenix Suns got the first pick in the NBA Draft Lottery.
								In all of the 50 years of the franchise's history, the Suns has never had the first pick.

							<br>
						<h2>2010</h2>
							<p>
								<p>
									In 2010, the Phoenix Suns made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they
									were only two wins away from going to the NBA finals. Unfortunately, they fell to 
									the Los Angeles Lakers. Up until now, this was the last Phoenix Suns playoff
									apperance.

						<h2>2005-2007</h2>
							<p> 
								<p>
									One of the most well known Phoenix Suns players, Steve Nash, won back to back 
									MVPs. The Most Valuable Player award is a prestigious award given to the player
									that league deemed the best performing and most important player to their team, 
									league-wide. This was also the era in which Steve Nash brought fun and fast paced
									basketball to the Valley.

						<h2>1992-1996</h2>
							<p>
								<p>
									Known as the "Charles Barkley era," this marked one of the two times the Phoenix Suns
									have made the NBA Finals. In 1993, the Phoenix Suns were two wins away from grabbing their 
									first NBA Championship, but eventually fell to the Michael Jordan led Chicago Bulls.
									Charles Barkley also won MVP in 1993.

								<br>
						<h2>1976</h2>
							<p>
								<p>
									The only other Finals trip for the Phoenix Suns happened in 1976. The Suns had an up and
									down season, but were able to make it to the playoffs with a 42-40 record. They faced the Boston 
									Celtics in the NBA Finals, a team who had at the time won 12 championships already. The Suns 
									fought hard, but eventually fell in 6 games.

								<br>
						<h2>1968</h2>
							<p>
								<p>
									1968 is the year the Phoenix Suns became an official NBA team. They paid a 2 million dollar
									entry fee, and was formed and owned by Karl Eller. There were critics behind putting a 
									basketball team in Phoenix, but it seems to have worked out well today.
