				<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
					<ul id="funfactslist">
						<li><span class="bold">Ducks have excellent vision</span>, thanks to the shape of their eyes, they can see objects both near and far simultaneously. To top it off, ducks have three eyelids and can see in color.</li>
						<li>Ducks are capable of sensing threats in the environment in <span class="bold">under a second</span>.</li>
						<li>Because a duck's eyes are located on either side of its head, they have a <span class="bold">field of vision of nearly 340 degrees</span>.</li>	
						<li>Preening is the process by which ducks groom themselves—getting rid of <span class="bold">dust, dirt, and parasites</span> from their feathers, while also helping to waterproof their outer layer. During preening, ducks spread a waxy, waterproof oil secreted by their uropygial gland, which is located near their tails.</li> 
						<li>After a male duck, or drake's, chosen mate is hatching eggs,the birds undergo <span class="bold">molting</span>, temporarily losing their bright plumage, as well as their ability to fly.</li>
						<li>The <span class="bold">more daylight there is</span>, the <span class="bold">more eggs a hen produces</span>. Farmers who raise ducks will often turn to artificial lighting in order to give their hens about 17 hours of light a day.</li>
						<li>The <span class="bold">omnivorous</span> birds also tend to consume gravel, small stones, or sand—not for the nutritional value, but so they can store the substances in their gizzards and use the rough textures to break down food.</li>
						<li>Very rarely, a severe weather event will trigger a mass migration known as a <span class="bold">“grand passage”</span>. There have been only three recorded instances of grand passages: one in 1940, one in 1955, and the most recent in 1995, when a reported 90 million waterfowl migrated from Canada after a severe cold front set in, causing major problems at airports along the birds' route. </li>
						<li>Unlike the young of many other animals, ducklings achieve independence almost <span class="bold">immediately after hatching</span>.</li>
						<li>Their webbed feet have no nerves or blood vessels, rendering them <span class="bold">incapable of feeling the cold</span>. Which is an important adaptation when you consider that ducks can be found on every continent except for the inhospitable Antarctica.</li>
						<li>Ducks can <span class="bold">live longer than dogs</span>, Desi the Duck, a female mallard who lived in the United Kingdom, was 20 years old when she died, making her the world’s oldest duck ever. The average lifespan of a duck is between 5-10 years, but domesticated ducks can live into their teens.</li>
