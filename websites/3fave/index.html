				<h2>David's 3 Favorite Things</h2>
				
				<div class="clear, clearfix">
					<img src="images/videogames.jpg" alt="League of Legends" class="leftpic">
					<h3 class="righttext">Video Games</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="righttext">Ever since I was younger, I played video games of all sorts. When I was around nine years old, I bought my first gameboy advanced SP with the help of my parents. I enjoy a variety of games, ranging from League of Legends to Pokémon. I used to own a lot of Nintendo consoles and handhelds, before moving onto PC gaming when I got my first laptop entering high school. Since then, most of the games I play today are on my PC I built myself.</p>

				<div class="clear, clearfix">
					<img src="images/basketball.jpg" alt="Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns" class="rightpic">
					<h3 class="lefttext">Basketball</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="lefttext">I like watching and playing basketball. My mom introduced me when I was around 5 years old, where I would watch games on T.V. with her. I used to like the Houston Rockets growing up, with Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming being a great duo to watch. When they started to succumb to injuries, I started following Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns when they were still a decent team around 2006. Now a days, they have not been to the playoffs in almost 10 years, and it's been a hard time being a Suns fan, but there's some home state pride that keeps me rooting for them, and hoping they will eventually find success.</p>

				<div class="clear, clearfix">
					<img src="images/music.jpg" alt="Canadian singer named Lights" class="leftpic">
					<h3 class="righttext">Music</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="righttext">While not the biggest music fanatic, I do listen to quite a variety of genres. Listening on commutes, while doing homework, or just for fun is what makes music so versatile. Some of my favorite artists include Panic! at the Disco, Lights, and No Doubt. I also enjoy cinematic music, with Studio Ghibli having some of my favorite songs to listen to in order to get lost in their world. The soundtrack for Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Howl's Moving Castle especially take me away.</p>
