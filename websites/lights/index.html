					<h3>
					Lights is a Canadian born singer that released her first official album in 2009. She has since gone on to do various other ventures, from creating more albums, to creating her own comic! 
					</h3>
					
					<p>
						Lights changed her legal name when she was 18, stemming from her last name Poxleitner. She married her husband Beau Bokan in 2012, and he is the lead vocalist of the band <span class="former">Bless the Falls</span>. They had a child in 2014, under the name of Rocket. Lights has won the Juno Award for  <span class="former">Pop Album of the Year</span> for her albums <span class="former">Siberia</span>, <span class="former">Little Machines</span>, and <span class="former">Skin & Earth.</span>	
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Lights started off on Myspace, and continued her way up until she released her first selftitled Extended Play. She then went on to release four studio albums as of 2019, and has some acoustic albums as well as extended plays.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						While Lights has been making music since 2008, I myself only started listening a lot in late 2017. I started listening due to hearing people covering her song online, and quickly got drawn in. My favorite album is <span class="former">Siberia</span>, with the song "Cactus in the Valley" being my favorite, which has nothing to do with me living in Arizona, home of the cactus, but certainly makes for a better reason. Other songs I enjoy include "Quiet," "Muscle Memory," and "Don't Go Home Without Me."
